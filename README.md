# SpanSportLeagueCodingAssesment
I have created a program for the Span coding challenge I was sent 

For context I decided to use Springboot and create a rest API for simplicity so that it is easy to run from any evironment. 
There is no complex setup once the application has been downloaded it can be run and you can use postman in order to test the application 

The application accepts a JSON entry with the following format 

    Lions 3, Snakes 3
    Tarantulas 1, FC Awesome 0
    Lions 1, FC Awesome 1
    Tarantulas 3, Snakes 1
    Lions 4, Grouches 0

I will attach the postman collection I have on my side to make it easy to extract and test using
